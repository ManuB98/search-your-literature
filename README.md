# search-your-literature

This project converts either all your PDFs or the PDFs of your choice to raw text stored in a parquet file that you can open in Positron. 

It will also include a script that gives you an example of how you can then search the literature with the use of keywords like in a traditional literature database, but now including all the text from all of the PDFs, not just abstracts, titles or article keywords. 

Lastly, it will include a script that you can use to incorporate a local llm to work with your literature.
